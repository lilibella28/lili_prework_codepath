## Notes: The biggest challenge I encountered while building the application was that I had never worked with Xcode before, so I had to learn how to navigate it. However, once I became familiar with it, things were easy to set up.


## Favorite App: Pinterest
1. Favorite Feature: Skin tone matching for personalized content.
   - Why I Like It: This feature tailors beauty and style recommendations to my preferences, making it a more inclusive and customized experience.

##App Idea
  - If I could improve an app, I would focus on Pinterest remaining loyal to its initial purpose by prioritizing human connection above all else. This could include features that encourage meaningful interactions between users, such as collaborative boards with real-time chats or personalized recommendations that foster community engagement around shared interests.
